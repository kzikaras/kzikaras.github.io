short-description: BlocJams, a mobile-friendly music player

---
Bloc Jams is a music player with a mobile-friendly interface. This music app is just as at home in your pocket as it is on your laptop or large desktop screen.

The Bloc Jams project was the first project I undertook while in the Bloc Web Development apprenticeship and gave me experience using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. The purpose of working through this app was to learn common development practices and skills while working on a real application. The assignment gave me a real-world problem to solve, and enforced mobile-friendly practices in regards to styling.

After completing the Bloc Jams application, I moved on to refactoring it with two additional technologies. To show the power of utilizing libraries, I was introduced to jQuery to clean up some of the Javascript code. This allowed for easier DOM manipulation, and a much faster development process. After I finished the jQuery project, I moved on to Angular, which was almost a complete re-build of Bloc Jams. Bloc Jams turned out to be a great application to demonstrate the power of Angular due to the nature of a music player. Utilizing Angular allowed me to develop the application quicker while adding some performance enhancements as well.

The Bloc Jams project was a great introduction to front-end web development. At first, I was a little overwhelmed by the amount of code involved to create a simple music player. However, I learned that by using frameworks and libraries, faster development was possible. If I had been creating this app from scratch I would have chosen to build it as an Angular application. I am already applying the knowledge and skills I've learned from Bloc Jams to my new projects.
