short-description: BlocJams, a mobile-friendly music player

---
Bloc Jams is a music player with a mobile-friendly interface. This music app is just as at home in your pocket as it is on your laptop or large desktop screen.

The Bloc Jams project was the first project I undertook while in the Bloc Web Development apprenticeship. The purpose of working through this app was to learn common development practices and skills while working on a real app that we've all used in some form before. This project played out as a "code along" in some cases, but on many occasions I was asked to take what I had learned and finish certain milestones on my own.
