Hi, I'm Kurt! Thank you for visiting my portfolio site. I am an aspiring software developer and technology professional from Connecticut. I work as a desktop support technician at Sikorsky Aircraft and spend most of my free time creating web applications. I also enjoy playing with my dog and playing video games. Have a look around, and if you need to get in touch please visit the contact page.
